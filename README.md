# Scratch Website

Welcome to the Scratch Website project! This is a hands-on initiative where I'll be building a web page from the ground up, exclusively using HTML and CSS. The goal is to showcase expertise in web development fundamentals without relying on external libraries or frameworks.


## Project Overview

- **No External Dependencies**: Pure HTML and CSS, no external frameworks or JavaScript.
- **Skill Showcase**: Utilize  HTML/CSS knowledge to create a web page that highlights your skills.


Happy coding! to me  ðŸš€
